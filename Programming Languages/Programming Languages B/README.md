# Programming Languages, Part B

### University of Washington

Week 1 has a lot of content. First, we will cover various Racket basics and
(quickly) see how we can program in a similar functional style to ML but with a
very different syntax. Then we will focus on several programming idioms related
to "delaying evaluation" by putting a computation in the body of a
zero-argument function. The homework assignment is a collection of fairly short
but often challenging functions on different topics.

Week 2 first presents Racket structs and how they serve many of the roles of
ML's datatype bindings but in a dynamically typed language. Then we will focus
on the main topic of Homework 5: writing an interpreter to implement a
programming language, particularly implementing function closures. While there
are many fewer lectures than Week 1 and in weeks of Part A, the homework is
more challenging and more rewarding.

Week 3 leverages our experience programming in both ML and Racket, discussing
what it means to have a static type system in a language and the various
advantages and disadvantages of doing so. Because this material does not lend
itself to programming problems, this week will just have a short quiz covering
some of the content. But rest assured that the content is not "theoretical" --
it is essential perspective on how to think about type systems (or the lack
thereof) to be a more effective software developer.
