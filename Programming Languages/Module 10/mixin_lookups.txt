Mixin Lookup Rules
------------------


When looking for receiver `obj`'s method `m`, look in `obj`'s class, then
mixins that class includes, then `obj`'s superclass, then the superclass's
mixins, etc.

Mixins included in same level shadow each other depending on the order they
were included. Ones included later shadow ones included before.

Instance variables operate on the same class level (the instance itself), so
they override each other the same way the would with any other style. This is
poor style, don't set instance variables in mixins.
