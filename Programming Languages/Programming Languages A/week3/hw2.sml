(* Your solutions must use pattern-matching. You may not use the functions

(* 1a. Write a function all_except_option, which takes a string and a string
   list. Return NONE if the string is not in the list, else return SOME lst
   where lst is identical to the argument list except the string is not in it.
   You may assume the string is in the list at most once. Use same_string,
   provided to you, to compare strings. Sample solution is around 8 lines. *)

(* 1b. Write a function get_substitutions1, which takes a string list list (a
   list of list of strings, the substitutions) and a string s and returns a
   string list. The result has all the strings that are in some list in
   substitutions that also has s, but s itself should not be in the result.

   Assume each list in substitutions has no repeats. The result will have
   repeats if s and another string are both in more than one list in
   substitutions.

   except it uses a tail-recursive local helper function. *)

   substitutions (as in parts (b) and (c)) and a full name of type
   {first:string,middle:string,last:string} and returns a list of full names
   (type {first:string,middle:string,last:string} list). The result is all the
   full names you can produce by substituting for the first name (and only the
   first name) using substitutions and parts (b) or (c). The answer should
   begin with the original name (then have 0 or more other names) *)
