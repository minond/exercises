(* 6. Write a function get_nth that takes a list of strings and an int n and *)

(* 7. Write a function date_to_string that takes a date and returns a string of *)
(* the form January 20, 2013 (for example). Use the operator ^ for concatenating *)
(* strings and the library function Int.toString for converting an int to a *)
(* string. For producing the month part, do not use a bunch of conditionals. *)

(* 8. Write a function number_before_reaching_sum that takes an int called sum, *)
(* which you can assume is positive, and an int list, which you can assume *)
(* contains all positive numbers, and returns an int.  You should return an int n *)
(* such that the first n elements of the list add to less than sum, but the first *)
(* n + 1 elements of the list add to sum or more. Assume the entire list sums to *)
(* more than the passed in value; it is okay for an exception to occur if this is *)
(* not the case. *)

(* 9. Write a function what_month that takes a day of year (i.e., an int between 1 *)
(* and 365) and returns what month that day is in (1 for January, 2 for February, *)
(* etc.). Use a list holding 12 integers and your answer to the previous problem. *)

(* 10. Write a function month_range that takes two days of the year day1 and day2 *)
(* and returns an int list [m1,m2,...,mn] where m1 is the month of day1, m2 is the *)
(* month of day1+1, ..., and mn is the month of day day2. Note the result will *)
(* have length day2 - day1 + 1 or length 0 if day1>day2. *)

(* 11. Write a function oldest that takes a list of dates and evaluates to an *)
(* (int*int*int) option. It evaluates to NONE if the list has no dates and SOME d *)
(* if the date d is the oldest date in the list. *)
