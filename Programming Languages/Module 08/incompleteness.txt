Incompleteness
==============

Almost anything you might like to check statically is undecidable. Any static
checker cannot do all of: always terminate, always be sound, always be
complete. This is a mathematical theorem


Examples:

- Will this function terminate on some input?
- Will this function ever use a variabnle not in the environement?
- Will this function treat a string as a function?
- Will this functino divide by zero?


Undecidability is an essential concept at the core of computing. The inherent
approximation of static checking is probably its most important ramification.
