Weak Typing (C/C++)

There exists programs that, by definition, must pass static checking but then
when run can "set the computer on fire". Why?

- Ease of language implementation: checks are left to the programmer
- Performance: dynamic checks take time
- Lower level: compiler does not insert information like array sizes, so it
  cannot do the checks

Weak typing is a poor name. Really about doing neither static nor dynamic
checks. A big problem is array bounds, which most PLs check dynamically, C/C++
allow this operation and let the program access parts of memory that are not
associated with the array/variable.

Weak typing really means a type system that allows programs for which a correct
language implementation is allowed to do anything, even something totally
unrelated to the code in the program - it can run illegal programs and cause
anything to happen.
