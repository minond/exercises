Suppose a type system were unsound. What could the PL do?

- Fix it with an updated language definition?
- Insert dynamic checks as needed to prevent X from happening?
- Just allow X to happen even if it "tried to stop it"?
- Worse: allow not just X, but anything to happen if "programmer gets it wrong"
