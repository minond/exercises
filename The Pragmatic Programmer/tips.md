# The Pragmatic Programmer


#### _By Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas_


### 1. Care About Your Craft

Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?


### 2. Think! About Your Work

Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constanly critique and appraise your
work.


### 3. Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses

Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what
can be done.


### 4. Don't Live with Broken Windows

Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.


### 5. Be a Catalyst for Change

You can't force change on people. Instead, show them how the future might be
and help them participate in creating in.


### 6. Remember the Big Picture

Don't get so engrossed in the details that you forget to check what's happening
around you.


### 7. Make Quality a Requirements Issue

Involve your users in determining the project's real quality requirements.


### 8. Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio

Make learning a habit.


### 9. Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear

Don't be swayed by vendors, media hype, or dogma. Analyze information in terms
of you and your project.


### 10. It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It

There's no point in having great ideas if you don't communicate them
effetively.


### 11. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative
representation within a system.


### 12. Make It Easy to Reuse

If it's easy to reuse, people will. Create an environment that supports reuse.


### 13. Elimiate Effects Between Unrelated Things

Design components that are self-contained, independent, and have a single,
well-defined purpose.


### 14. There Are No Final Decisions

No decision is cast in stone. Instead, consider each as being written in the
sand at the beach, and plan for change.


### 15. Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target

Tracer bullets let you home in yon your target by trying things and seeing how
close they lang.


### 16. Prototype to Learn

Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code you
produce, but in the lessons you learn.


### 17. Program Close to the Problem Domain

Design and code in your user's language.


### 18. Estimate to Avoid Surprises

Estimate before you start. You'll spot potential problems up front.


### 19. Iterate the Schedule with the Code

Use experience you gain as you implement to refine the project time scales.


### 20. Keep Knowledge in Plain Text

Plain text won't become obsolete. It helps leverage your work and simplifies
debugging and testing.


### 21. Use the Power of Command Shells

Use the shell when graphical user interfaces don't cut it.


### 22. Use a Single Editor Well

The editor should be an extension of your hand; make sure your editor is
configurable, extensible, and programmable.
