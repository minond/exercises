Implementation of a function call

For each function **call** during run-time, the implementation has to:
- pass parameters from the calling function to the called function,
- determine the return address within the caller's code,
- save the caller's return address, stack, and memory segments, and finally
- jump to execute the called function.

For each function **return** during run-time, the implementation has to :
- return to the caller the value computed by the called function,
- recycle the memory resources used by the called function,
- reinstate the caller's stack and memory segments, and finally
- jump to the return address in the caller's code.
