# Hello World

The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read [D page](http://exercism.io/languages/d) on
exercism.io.  This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.

## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd).
Create just enough structure by declaring namespaces, functions, classes,
etc., to satisfy any compiler errors and get the test to fail.  Then write
just enough code to get the test to pass.  Once you've done that,
uncomment the next test by moving the following line past the next test.

```D
static if (all_tests_enabled)
```

This may result in compile errors as new constructs may be invoked that
you haven't yet declared or defined.  Again, fix the compile errors minimally
to get a failing test, then change the code minimally to pass the test,
refactor your implementation for readability and expressiveness and then
go on to the next test.

Try to use standard D facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.  [DRefLanguage](https://dlang.org/spec/spec.html)
and [DReference](https://dlang.org/phobos/index.html) are references to the D language and D standard library.
