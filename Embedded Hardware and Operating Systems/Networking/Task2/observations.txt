# Observations

Network with 10 motes that announce their precence on the network in order for
other motes to learn of them and save a record of their address in a list of
neighbors. Then, on a timer, a message is sent to a neighbor picked at random.
The message is a simple string that includes the node id of the node where the
message originated from.
