# Note

I think there is something I do not understand about this assignment's
requirements. The way I read this instruction "Simulate trickle (Rime) in
Cooja. Modify an etimer value in the code with different values, 10 power of
(-20) * CLOCK_SECOND, ..." is to place (10^-20)CLOCK_SECOND (where `^` is an
exponent operator and not xor) as the etimer's interval, which is impossible
because a timer's interval is just an `unsigned short` which is not able to
hold the result of that calculation. I will instead use x, 2x, and 10x where x
is `CLOCK_SECOND` as my intervals.

# Observations

The lower the interval the more messages that are sent.
